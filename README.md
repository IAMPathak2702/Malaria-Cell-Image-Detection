# Malaria Cell Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to detect malaria-infected cells using TensorFlow. The dataset used in this project consists of 27,558 images of cells categorized into "Infected" and "Uninfected" folders. This dataset is sourced from the official NIH website but has been made accessible for faster access.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the official NIH website: [NIH Malaria Datasets](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/)
- Infected: Contains images of malaria-infected cells.
- Uninfected: Contains images of healthy cells.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/IAMPathak2702/Malaria-Cell-Image-Detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data and model.
4. Train the model using the provided scripts.
